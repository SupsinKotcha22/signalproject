 Optimisation of self-labeling-refinement pipeline on EEG classification model for Harmful Brain Activity Classification competition

In our project, we have investigated the optimization of the self-labeling refinement pipeline by combining the original labels with the pseudo-labels generated by the model. We applied the same process to 25% , 50% , 75% and 100% of the data separately with high quality labels, resulting in a new dataset.
